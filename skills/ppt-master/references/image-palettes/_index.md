# Palettes — Index

A **palette** is the deck's **color behavior** — proportion, role, temperament. It does **not** supply HEX values; those come from `design_spec.colors`. The palette tells the model how to use the HEX values: which dominates, which carries accent, what proportion the background occupies, what the overall temperament feels like.

> Why this split: SVG renders the HEX precisely from `design_spec`. The AI image must use the **same HEX values** so the image visually belongs in the deck — but the image needs more than a HEX list; it needs a **usage rule**. That's the palette.
